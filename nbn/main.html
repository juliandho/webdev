<h>Australian NBN: Change is coming but what should be done?</h>
<p><img src="./nbn/change.jpg" width="100" height="90" align="left" class="hires" /><img src="lowres.jpg" align="left" class="lowres" />
The NBN is not perfect nor sacred, and with significant learnings by the whole industry over the last 4 years it is now time to revise it. In the politicized debate on the Australian NBN there has been no discussion on what changes should be made to improve it. We present a list of changes that address the market, regulatory, and technology issues with the current NBN:
<p>
<b>Private-Public Partnership - achieve greater efficiencies by restoring a contestable market</b><br> 
<i>Currently NBN Co is a Governement Monopoly that is crowding-out the market– with no performance incentives and has the ability to extract monopoly profits</i>
<ul>
<li>Government provides low interest funding to subsidize the cost of the rollout. Payment on active subscriber, and a graduated subsidy based technology deployed.</li>
<li>Divide the country into regions – large enough for economies of scale.</li>
<li>Open each region for competitive tender, with one operator being allocated to each region to Build, Own, and Operate the network.</li> 
<li>To create competitive tensions allow operators to expand beyond allocated region (although without subsidy).</li>
<li>Each Greenfield site open to tender, with supplier of last resort being the operator of that region.</li>
<li>Remove restrictions on Layer-2 only services – currently unprofitable.</li> 
<li>Satellite network continued to be a managed service paid by the government.</li>
<li>Allow for both fixed and mobile wireless to be provided.</li>
<li>Allow for the re-use of existing assets, e.g. DSL and HFC.</li>
<li>Reduce the size of the FTTH rollout, and increase the wireless and satellite footprints to service customers in remote areas faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>NBN Co’s Role – Governance body</b><br> 
<i>NBN Co take a role similar to Crown Fibre Holdings (NZ)</i>
<ul>
<li>Standardize the design of NBN approved networks – mandate the network design, wholesale products, equipment, and processes, and provide testing and on-boarding. Re-use all the design work already done by NBN Co.</li>
<li>Validate the network and approve subsidy to each operator.</li>
<li>Continue with the FTTH rollout up to the 2015 plan of 3.5m homes (1/3 of network) – contracts have been signed and work is underway. This network can be later vested into each regional operator, with the cost taken from the government subsidy to connect the rest of the network.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Regulatory Environment and Access Agreements</b><br>
<i>All the heavy lifting already done, need only to renegotiate access to copper</i>
<ul>
<li>(Legislation) Ultra-broadband > 25Mbps must be wholesale open access.</li>
<li>(Legislation) Telstra cannot supply retail Ultra-broadband services, unless minister exemption.</li> 
<li>(Telstra agreement)  All Telstra customers will be transferred to NBN.</li> 
<li>Acquisition of exclusive access to the copper requires negotiation with Telstra - substitute the leasing of lead-in conduits in FTTH for access to the lead-in copper line for FTTN. Delivers similar value to Telstra shareholders</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Heterogeneous network – Deploying fiber to the most economical point.</b><br>
<i>Currently inefficient FTTH rollout – high cost and long delays due to constraint of a single technology</i> 
<ul>
<li>NBN Co enforces a minimum design rule e.g. 25Mbps.</li>
<li>Green fields mandate the use of FTTH.</li>
<li>Operator can choose the technology depending on cost and expected customer revenue.</li>
<li>Metro – FTTN, FTTdp (drop point – in pit), or FTTH.</li> 
<li>MDUs FTTN likely – higher lead-in cost than SDUs, having to traverse multiple levels and corridors and through concrete walls and within conduits.</li> 
<li>Rural areas FTTN likely – ADSL bonding, ADSL2+ extended reach mode.</li>
<li>FTTN is more economical with the 100% subscriber migration – full utilization of the equipment in the node/pit.</li>
</ul>

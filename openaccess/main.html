<h>Ultra-Broadband Networks: Should more bandwidth be our highest priority?</h>
<p><img src="./openaccess/openaccess.jpg" width="100" height="90" align="left" class="hires" /><img src="lowres.jpg" align="left" class="lowres" />
Ultra-fast broadband networks of 100Mbps and above are now being deployed globally. In the 90’s the first broadband networks fulfilled a range of needs, and consequentially sparked the Internet revolution. Based on this past experience governments have placed significant priority on Ultra-fast broadband networks as a driver for future economic growth.</p>
<p><b>It's more than just the bandwidth</b><br>High bandwidth numbers make great headlines and boost a country’s OECD Internet rankings, however, in the foreseeable future Ultra-fast broadband will be utilized by only very niche applications. Increasing only bandwidth will not produce as great an economic benefit as compared to increasing broadband penetration, i.e. increasing the addressable market, and increasing the range of services that can operate on today’s fixed broadband networks, i.e. improving network reliability, different classes of services, and reliable video streaming. All of which can be achieved by augmenting today’s networks at minimal cost. </p>
<p><b>Who wants to be stuck at home?</b><br>Rather than focus on fixed networks, creating a competitive wireless market should be the priority for governments and regulators. The value of fixed networks is being surpassed by wireless. In 2011, 34% of homes in the US were wireless only, i.e. had substituted fixed with wireless. Today’s consumers demand that their data is accessible at Anytime, Anywhere, and on Anydevice. This characterization is a result of our modern lifestyles - as we become more nomadic and asset light. In this environment consumers place higher value on mobility than the higher-speeds of fixed networks, as evident by the higher pricing for mobile data, 1.2c/MB on wireless and only 0.1c/MB on fixed (Telstra). </p>
<p><b><u>Strategies:</u></b><br>
<b>Fixed + Mobile Operators:</b> Astute investment in fixed networks and with less reliance on fixed-only applications. Investment should spent on augmenting the network to increase the range of services that can operate on the fixed network to differentiate from wireless, and converge the core-network to support both fixed and wireless access.<br>
<b>Fixed-only Operators:</b> With the difficulties in building a new wireless network must partner with mobile wholesale operators. Upgrade their networks to support wireless, and hence depend as little on their partner’s wireless infrastructure as possible.

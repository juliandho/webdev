<h>Software Defined Networks (SDN): What is it and what will it really do?</h>

Network control protocols calculate the traffic paths in a network. Each network router autonomously uses these protocols to discover the topology of the network. Although based on open standards these protocols are developed by equipment vendors and are locked into their routers, inaccessible to 3rd parties. Software Defined Networks (SDN) was started by a group of academics that wanted to gain access to these control protocols for their research. To do so SDN proposes to move these control protocols from within each network router into a centralized SDN controller/server in SW that is open for all to modify. The SDN network control architecture has become the hottest topic in telecommunication due to a number of unforeseen benefits it could provide:<br>
<br>
<b>Benefits:</b>
<ul>
<li>Allow the modification of routing software, ability to rapidly develop and deploy new features in the network.</li>
<li>Enable the use of low-cost commodity routing hardware, with all the ‘smarts’ in SW the SDN controller.</li>
<li>A centralized SDN controller gives operators full visibility and control of the network.</li>
<li>With absolute control of the network the operators can use the network as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) i.e. third-parties are able to buy guaranteed network resources on demand.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b><u>Strategies:</u></b><br>
<b>Network vendors:</b> Commoditization of network routers threatens the whole business model of network vendors. However, the ability to implement SDN is questionable, e.g. the scalability of a centralized controller will be the largest challenge. Recommended strategy is to monitor the progress of SDN, especially the ownership of the SDN controller space.<br>
<b>Datacenter Operators:</b> A number of enhancements to Ethernet (DCB, PCF, ETS, DCBX, etc) will address the current issues of Ethernet in Datacenters, and will be widely adopted before SDN reaches the market.<br>
<b>Telecommunication Operators:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>More value can be created by developing new services for customers rather than bespoke network control software, especially where existing overlay technologies such as MPLS already deliver sufficient network control.</li>
<li>The most promising idea to come out of SDN is IaaS. Coupled with datacenters, third-parties will be able to buy their computing and storage services on demand. The customer interface and resource orchestration required can be done solely at the OSS level, without the need for  SDN.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Software Defined Network (SDN) is just starting the climb up the hype-cycle. SDN will go through a number of evolutions, and what comes out at the end is unlikely to resemble what it started out as.</b></p>  <img src="./sdn/HypeCycle.jpg" class="align-left medium" /> 
<p>SDN started with the idea of relocating (‘virtualizing’) the control of the network outside of vendor-locked routers and into a centralized controller that is open for all to access. Academics and network operators could then write their own network control software, which until now was done by the vendors, i.e. standard control protocols that had been defined by these very same academics, to run on any dumb low-cost hardware. Although this extra degree of freedom is appealing for academia, network operators are more focused on profitability rather than writing bespoke network control software. Apart from academia, the open control software concept does not address any business need of the operators and is a threat to the network equipment vendors.</p>
<p>SDN has then evolved into a way of controlling the whole network. Currently network control is decentralized, with the routers able to autonomously discover and organize themselves. Although highly efficient, this does create uncertainty in the underlying network for many network sensitive services. Hence, overlay technologies are used to deterministically deliver network services, e.g. MPLS which reserves network resources. In an SDN world the central SDN controller will see and control all; discovery of the network, knowing the state of the network and controlling every traffic flow. However, with hundreds of routers and thousands of flows to manage and to do so with the required low latency seems unlikely.  Due to scalability limitations SDN will likely operate only on aggregate traffic flows and therefore extend only as far as the edge network at most. A hybrid approach seems more likely, with most traffic flows being controlled using the current decentralized approach, and only network sensitive traffic flows being centrally controlled.</p>
<p>The most promising idea to come out of SDN is the transformation of the network into being a utility service (IaaS). Third-party service providers will be able to buy network resources on demand from infrastructure providers.  In the context of datacentres, the service providers will be able to similarly buy their computing and storage services on demand. To do this requires the ordering, provisioning, and assurance of services for these third-parties to have very low transaction costs. The customer interface and resource orchestration required to do this is in fact an OSS play, i.e. what occurs in the underlying network, server farm, and storage farm to deliver these services is irrelevant to the customer. There is a clear business need for this on demand model; low capex spends, maximization of RoI on investments, elastic demands, low-barriers to entry, and service-based competition. How well this is executed will determine if the network operators are providing dumb pipes or a highly-valued service.</p>  
<p>Unfortunately, much has been written about defining, i.e. constraining, what is an SDN, but less so on its possibilities. SDN has been the catalyst for the industry to begin to reimagine networks and is likely to spark many more ideas as it evolves. Regardless of what SDN eventually becomes, like with IP and Ethernet, it is just a brand name.</p>

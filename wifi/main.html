<b>WiFi, WiFi everywhere but not a network in range</b><br>WiFi is on every device and is becoming available in most public spaces. In 2011 there were 1.3 million public WiFi hotspots and this is expected to more than triple to 5.8 million by 2015 (Informa). Its continual bandwidth advantages and simplicity of deployment should make WiFi a widely adopted commercial service and a key component in every operator’s network strategy. However, until now there have been many impediments to WiFi becoming a widely used as a commercial service.  For users the network selection and authentication process are manual and customers limited to only subscribed networks, being unable to roam to third-party networks.</p>
<p><b>Fired up and ready to go</b><br>The transformation of WiFi to a commercial service will occur with the adoption of 802.11u:"Internetworking with external networks" / Hotspot 2.0. The ease of connectivity and seamless roaming between networks will be like that experienced with today’s mobile networks:<br>
<ul>
<li>Connection to newly discovered subscribed and third-party partner networks will be automated.</li>
<li>Authentication will be seamless via SIM card, mobile app, device type, current location etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Opportunities</b><br>The introduction of commercial WiFi services will create a number of new business opportunities:
<ul>
<li>Wholesale WiFi operators that offer WiFi offload to wireless operators.</li>
<li>Fixed operators can create a wireless network by piggy-backing on installed homegateways.</li>
<li>WiFi-only operators offering a retail service via a mobile app.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As with all network builds there will be a land-grab for high-volume locations and the locking out of competitors where possible. The adoption of 802.11u will be rapid as Devices and Access Points can be enabled via firmware upgrades, however, the roaming between third-party networks will depend on the backend integration between operators.
<p><b><u>Strategies:</u></b><br>
<b>Wireless operators:</b> WiFi must be part of their Heterogeneous network strategy, using a mix of technologies and applying the technology where most appropriate.<br>
<b>Fixed operators:</b> Leverage the existing homegateway install base and public infrastructure.<br>
<b>WiFi wholesalers:</b> Use incentives to tie-up high volume locations, e.g. revenue sharing with site owners.<br>
